## High Points

### Previous Progress:

Frontend:
- created a working skeleton of the web pages
- added a *bit* of functionality

Backend:
- researched apis
- created working search function

Testing:
- created workflow: push the site to staging(remote server), push the change to GitHub, test runs automatically in GitHub but actually tests the remote staging server
- prepared unit tests
- push to remote server
- push to github
- Since in staging branch, you can push anything
- if tests pass, then merge to main (manually) and publish

### Future Goals:

Frontend and Backend:
- user login system
- database storing
- info for recipe cards hooked up (make functions for us to call when info needed)
- Em and Jonny want to meet with backend to connect things with design -> maybe polish some visuals
- Jonny and Ryan want to tap into a bit of backend (ie recipe management, tags, switching pages) based on skeletons
- Joanne plans to make the polished "home" page which is very similar to explore (currently we have explore for MVP),  meet with backend to answer questions about our work, AESTHETIC changes

Testing:
- further improve workflow
- ditch TestCafe for more basic unit testing (ie jest)
