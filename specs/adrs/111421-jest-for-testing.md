# Use NPM/Jest for Basic User Testing

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to appropriately test any code we push into the repo.

## Considered Options

- TestCafe
- NPM/Jest

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: NPM/Jest

This is because it helps us run simple, yet effective tests on the code we produce. It is a process that multiple team members are familiar with.
